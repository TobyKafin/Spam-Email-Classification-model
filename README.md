# Spam-Email-Classification-model

This project was originally done as part of the Data100 class at UC Berkeley in the spring of 2022. The goal was to build a logistic regression model to predict whether an email is spam or not.
I combined the two project parts into one file, cut all the unnecessary parts and autograder files/cells, and added some cells to make it cohesive. Enjoy!
